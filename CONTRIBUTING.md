# Contributing to Observal

Thank you for considering contributing to Observal! Contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug reports, bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, and tests. This guide walks you through the process from setting up your environment to getting your pull request merged.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python 3.11+)
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm (for the web frontend)
- Git

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Observal.git
cd Observal
```

3. Add the upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal.git
```

### Running Locally

No configuration needed for local development. All settings have working defaults.

**Full stack (Docker):**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

Wait for all services to be healthy (`docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps`), then install the CLI and log in:

```bash
uv tool install --editable .
observal auth login
```

The API starts at http://localhost:8000 and the web UI at http://localhost:3000. The `.env.example` seeds four demo accounts on first startup — log in with `super@demo.example` / `super-changeme` for full admin access. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for all demo credentials and the full step-by-step walkthrough.

**Frontend only (for UI work):**

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` in `web/.env.local` if the backend is on a different host.

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed configuration, eval engine setup, and troubleshooting.

## Enterprise Directory (`ee/`)

The `ee/` directory contains proprietary enterprise features licensed under the [Observal Enterprise License](ee/LICENSE). This code is **source-available** but requires a commercial license for production use.

**Community contributions are not accepted into `ee/`.** All code in that directory is written exclusively by the Observal team. Pull requests that modify files under `ee/` will be closed.

If you are unsure whether your change belongs in the open-source core or the enterprise directory, open an issue to discuss it first.

The open-source core must never depend on code in `ee/`. The dependency direction is strictly one-way:

- `ee/` code **can** import from the open-source core
- Open-source code **cannot** import from `ee/`

### Enterprise Setup

To develop or test enterprise features locally, set `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=enterprise` in your `.env` and follow the standard setup in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md). Enterprise mode enables SSO-only authentication, SCIM user provisioning, and audit logging. You will need to configure OAuth/OIDC variables (`OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OAUTH_SERVER_METADATA_URL`) — see the environment variables table in SETUP.md for details.

## Finding Work

Before starting work, check the [open issues](https://github.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal/issues) to see what needs attention.

- Look for issues labelled **good first issue** if you are new to the project.
- Comment on an issue to let others know you are working on it before you start.
- For larger features or architectural changes, open an issue to discuss your approach before writing code. This avoids wasted effort if the direction needs adjustment.

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Do not commit directly to `main`. Create a branch from the latest `main` with one of these prefixes:

- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation

```
feature/skill-registry
fix/clickhouse-insert-timeout
docs/update-setup-guide
```

### Code Style

Python is linted and formatted with `ruff`. Dockerfiles are linted with `hadolint`. Pre-commit hooks enforce both - install them early so issues are caught before you commit.

```bash
make hooks     # install pre-commit hooks
make format    # auto-format
make lint      # run linters
```

### Testing

```bash
make test      # quick
make test-v    # verbose
```

All tests must pass before submitting a PR. Tests mock all external services, so Docker does not need to be running. If you are adding a new feature or fixing a bug, include tests that cover the change.

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

```
feat(cli): add skill submit command
fix(telemetry): handle null span timestamps
docs: update contributing guide
```

Keep the subject line under 72 characters, use the imperative mood ("add", not "added"), and do not end it with a period. If more detail is needed, add a blank line after the subject and write a longer description wrapped at 80 characters.

### DCO Sign-off

All commits must include a `Signed-off-by` line to certify the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). The DCO is a lightweight agreement that confirms you wrote (or have the right to submit) your contribution and that it is licensed under the project's open-source GNU AGPL v3.0 license (for all code outside `ee/`).

Add the sign-off automatically with the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(cli): add skill submit command"
```

This appends a line like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Make sure your `user.name` and `user.email` in git config match the identity you want to use. A CI check will block PRs that have unsigned commits.

### Changelog

We maintain a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. When submitting a PR that adds a feature, fixes a bug, or makes any user-facing change, add an entry under the `[Unreleased]` section in the appropriate category:

- **Added** for new features
- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** for now removed features
- **Fixed** for bug fixes
- **Security** for vulnerability fixes

Example:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Resolve null span timestamp crash in telemetry ingestion
```

At release time, a maintainer will move unreleased entries into a versioned section.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Make sure your branch is up to date with `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. Push your branch to your fork.
3. Open a PR against `main` on the [Observal repository](https://github.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal).
4. Describe your changes clearly: what you changed and why. Link the related issue if one exists.
5. Ensure CI passes (linters, tests).
6. Ensure all commits are signed off (`git commit -s`).
7. Add a changelog entry if your change is user-facing.
8. Respond to review feedback and update your code if requested.

Keep pull requests focused on a single concern. It is better to open three small PRs that each address one issue than one large PR that mixes unrelated changes. Smaller PRs are easier to review and faster to merge.

## Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

Search [existing issues](https://github.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal/issues) first to avoid duplicates. When filing a bug report, include:

- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Expected behaviour** vs **actual behaviour**
- **Environment details**: OS, Python version, Node.js version, Docker version
- **Error logs or screenshots** if applicable

The more detail you provide, the faster the issue can be diagnosed.

### Feature Requests

Describe the use case clearly. Explain the problem you are trying to solve, not just the solution you have in mind. This helps maintainers evaluate the request in the broader context of the project.

## Codebase Context

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for internal architecture notes, file layout, and conventions. See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) for the full CLI command reference. Both are useful for new contributors and AI coding agents alike.

## License

This repository uses a dual-license structure. By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE), which covers all code outside the `ee/` directory. The `ee/` directory is licensed separately under the [Observal Enterprise License](ee/LICENSE) and does not accept community contributions.

The DCO sign-off on each commit is your explicit acknowledgement of this.
