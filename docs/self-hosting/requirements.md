# Requirements

Minimum and recommended specs for running the Observal stack.

## Hardware

| Profile | CPU | Memory | Disk | Who it's for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Developer | 2 vCPU | 4 GB | 20 GB | One engineer, local machine |
| Small team (≤10) | 2 vCPU | 6 GB | 50 GB | Small org, moderate telemetry |
| Team (10–50) | 4 vCPU | 12 GB | 200 GB + fast SSD | Typical production deployment |
| Large team (50+) | 8+ vCPU | 32 GB | 500 GB + fast SSD | High telemetry volume; consider externalizing ClickHouse |

The stack's Docker memory limits out-of-the-box:

| Service | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| `observal-api` | 512 MB |
| `observal-worker` | 512 MB |
| `observal-web` | 256 MB |
| `observal-clickhouse` | 1 GB |
| `observal-redis` | 256 MB |
| `observal-grafana` | 512 MB |

ClickHouse is the memory-hungry one. On a long-running team server, bump it to 2–4 GB in `docker/docker-compose.yml`.

## Disk: where the data goes

The heaviest user of disk is **ClickHouse**. Growth depends on:

* Number and length of harness sessions
* Raw transcript record size
* `DATA_RETENTION_DAYS`

Session transcripts vary significantly by harness and tool output size. Measure representative workloads and plan 2 to 3 times headroom over observed growth.

Postgres stays under 500 MB for most deployments; it holds only registry metadata and user accounts.

## Software

| Software | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker | ≥ 24.0 | With Compose v2 (`docker compose`, not `docker-compose`) |
| Linux / macOS host | any modern | Windows via WSL2 works |
| Bash / zsh | any | For the CLI install |

> [!NOTE]
> Homebrew's Docker formula is outdated and may ship an older Compose version. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or use your distro's upstream packages to get Docker Engine ≥ 24.0 with Compose v2.

For the **CLI** (developer machines, not the server):

* **Standalone binary** (recommended) -- no dependencies, just `curl | bash`
* Or Python **3.11, 3.12, or 3.13** with `uv`, `pipx`, or `pip`

## Network

* **Outbound HTTPS**: only needed to pull Docker images on first `docker compose up --build`. Not needed at runtime (the stack is fully self-contained).
* **Inbound**: users hit the API (`:8000`) and web (`:3000`). Telemetry from the shim is received on the API port.
* **Between services**: the private `observal-net` bridge handles all of it.

## TLS / HTTPS

The built-in nginx LB does not terminate TLS. For production, put a TLS proxy in front (Caddy, Traefik, AWS ALB) and terminate TLS there. Point it at `localhost:80` (the nginx LB).

Example (Caddy):

```caddyfile
observal.your-company.internal {
  reverse_proxy localhost:80
}
```
