# Welcome to Observal

Observal is a **self-hosted AI agent registry with built-in observability**. Think Docker Hub, but for AI coding agents.

It gives you three things the AI-agent ecosystem doesn't:

1. **A registry** — browse, publish, and install complete agent configurations. Each agent bundles its MCP servers, skills, hooks, prompts, and sandboxes into one portable YAML that installs cleanly into Claude Code, Kiro, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and more.
2. **A telemetry pipeline** — a transparent shim sits between your IDE and every MCP server. Every tool call becomes a span, spans group into traces, traces form sessions. Everything streams into ClickHouse with zero changes to the MCP servers themselves.
3. **An evaluation engine** — scores agent sessions on goal completion, tool efficiency, factual grounding, thought process, and adversarial robustness. Compare agent versions. See what actually works.

## Who this is for

- **AI engineers** who want to know which of their agents actually deliver results, not just look impressive in a demo.
- **Platform teams** running agents across a team or org who need visibility, governance, and a single source of truth.
- **Agent authors** who want to share their work and see how it performs on real workflows.
- **Operators** who want the entire stack self-hosted: Docker Compose up, no SaaS, no egress.

## Is Observal free?

Yes. Observal is open source under the GNU AGPL v3.0 license. Self-host the whole thing for free. There is an enterprise edition with SSO, SCIM, and audit logging, but everything covered in these docs works without it.
